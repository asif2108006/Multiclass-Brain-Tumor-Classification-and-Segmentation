I've been working on the LGG MRI Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle, which includes brain MRI scans and tumor masks to detect and segment lower-grade gliomas (LGG).

ðŸ‘‰ Classification: Used ResNet50 with transfer learning (ImageNet weights) â€“ achieved an impressive 98% accuracy 
ðŸ‘‰ Segmentation: Implemented a U-Net model to pinpoint tumor regions â€“ achieved 99% validation accuracy 

I also worked on a dataset that combines three sources: figshare, SARTAJ, and Br35H.
The dataset comprises a total of 7023 human brain MRI images, categorized into four distinct classes. The dataset focuses on brain tumors and their classification. The four classes are as follows:
Glioma: Cancerous brain tumors in glial cells.
Meningioma: Non-cancerous tumors originating from the meninges.
No Tumor: Normal brain scans without detectable tumors.
Pituitary: Tumors affecting the pituitary gland, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous
ðŸ‘‰For multiclass tumor detection, I used a CNN model with data augmentation and achieved an outstanding 99% accuracy! 

Itâ€™s amazing to see how deep learning can contribute to advancements in healthcare.
